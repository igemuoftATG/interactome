# interactome
IAAS: Interactome as a Service

Discussion and proposal for assembling a software capable of delivering on a self-hosted social-network-forum like application. An **interactome** for discussing synthetic biology from all perspectives and users. Faculty, grad students, professors, startups, companies, governments and education experts should all feel comfortable and secure using the software. Used for distributing information and powering discussion on

- conferences
- weekly/monthly newsletters
- webinars
- workshops
- guest speakers
- networking
- igem project feedback
- ogem mini networks to start

Integrations with
- email mailing lists (either self-hosted or mailchimp, etc.)
- slack
- google calendar/ iCal


Ideas
- weekly contributed markdown newsletter content, gets sent out if approved same time each week
  * good because multiple people can work on the weekly newsletter
  * bad because they will need to have a GitHub/GitLab account and be collaborators. doing this in-house with GitLab may help, but then people need to create a GitLab account under our org. 

See [awesome-selfhosted#social-networks-and-forums](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted#social-networks-and-forums) for a list of potentially applicable open source softwares.

## TODOS
- improve, make more clear, the proposal
- define project milestones
- investigate and compare existing open source software

## Potential Softwares to Use/Combine

<!-- confused how to write a markdown table? -->
<!-- see: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables -->
<!-- each row must be on one line. best editing environment will be a text editor with soft-wrap on -->
<!-- plus use link names like here to keep it cleaner -->
